# NQueen & NKnight Solver

## 🏆 Overview
This project provides efficient algorithms for solving the **N-Queens** and **N-Knights** problems using **backtracking**, **pruning optimizations**, and **heuristic-based techniques** to ensure optimal performance.

### N-Queens Problem 🏰
The **N-Queens problem** requires placing `N` queens on an `N x N` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

### N-Knights Problem ⚔️
The **N-Knights problem** involves placing `N` knights on an `N x N` chessboard without any knight being able to attack another.
